# Alfred Bot: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

The Alfred Bot is an intelligent conversational AI designed to provide accurate and context-aware responses to user queries. It leverages semantic search and a structured knowledge base to understand user intent and deliver relevant information. The primary goal is to offer a seamless and efficient information retrieval experience for users.

## 2. Goals

- To provide highly accurate and relevant answers to user questions based on a curated knowledge base.
- To maintain a high confidence level in intent recognition and semantic matching.
- To offer a natural and intuitive conversational interface.
- To be easily extensible with new knowledge and features.
- To manage conversation context effectively for improved user experience.

## 3. Target Audience

- Users seeking quick and accurate information from the bot's knowledge base.
- Developers and administrators responsible for maintaining and extending the bot's functionality and knowledge.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Conversational Interface

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Ability to interpret user queries in natural language.
- **Intent Recognition:** Identify the underlying purpose or topic of a user's query.
- **Semantic Search:** Retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base based on semantic similarity, not just keywords.
- **Context Management:** Maintain and utilize conversation history and session variables to enhance understanding and response generation.
- **Response Generation:** Provide clear, concise, and appropriate responses based on identified intent and retrieved knowledge.
- **Fallback Responses:** Gracefully handle queries that cannot be confidently matched to existing knowledge.

### 4.2 Knowledge Base Management

- **Structured Knowledge Base:** Store information in a well-defined format (e.g., JSON) with intents, patterns, responses, and metadata.
- **Extensibility:** Allow for easy addition, modification, and removal of knowledge entries.
- **Metadata Utilization:** Leverage metadata (e.g., categories, tags, confidence thresholds) to improve search and context handling.

### 4.3 Core Services and API

- **Text Processing:** Preprocessing of text (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization) and generation of vector embeddings using sentence-transformers.
- **Vector Storage:** Efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings (ChromaDB).
- **Session Management:** Persistence and management of user session data (Redis).
- **API Interface:** Provide a robust RESTful API for external applications to interact with the bot.

#### 4.3.1 API Endpoints
- **/api/v1/chat/**: Main endpoint for processing user messages and receiving bot responses.
- **/api/v1/session/**: Endpoints for creating, managing, and retrieving session information.
- **/api/v1/health/**: Endpoints for monitoring the health of the application and its dependencies.

For a complete and up-to-date list of endpoints, please see the [API Documentation](./api.md).

## 5. Performance and Confidence Requirements

- **High Confidence Matching:** The system should aim for a high confidence score (e.g., >= 0.7) for final intent matches to ensure accuracy. A lower threshold (e.g., 0.25) is used for initial candidate retrieval from the vector store.
- **Low False Positives:** Minimize instances where the bot confidently matches an intent that is irrelevant to the user's query.
- **Efficient Response Time:** Provide timely responses, ideally under 1-2 seconds for most requests.

## 6. Technical Considerations

- **Language:** Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** FastAPI, sentence-transformers, ChromaDB, Redis, Pydantic.
- **Deployment:** Dockerized application for consistent and scalable deployment.

## 7. Quality Assurance and Testing

- **Unit Testing:** Core services, utilities, and data models must be covered by unit tests.
- **Integration Testing:** The interaction between different services must be validated through integration tests.
- **API Testing:** The FastAPI endpoints must be tested to ensure they handle requests and responses as expected.
- **CI/CD:** A continuous integration pipeline should be established to automatically run tests.

## 8. System and Operations

### 8.1 Configuration
The system must be configurable through environment variables to allow for easy adaptation to different environments.

### 8.2 Deployment
The application is designed to be deployed as a set of Docker containers, orchestrated using `docker-compose`.

### 8.3 Monitoring and Health Checks
The application must provide health check endpoints to allow for external monitoring of the service's status.

## 9. Future Enhancements (Potential)

- **Multi-language Support**
- **Advanced NLP Features (e.g., NER)**
- **Integration with External Systems**
- **User Feedback Mechanism**
- **Security Hardening**
